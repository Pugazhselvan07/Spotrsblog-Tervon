 <p class="fw-bold">The injured Dallas Cowboys defensive back made it clear watching Monday Night Football last night: his brother, Stefon, needs to get out of Buffalo ASAP!
</p>

<p>
    There is some MAJOR drama in Buffalo! The Bills offense is a shadow of itself in 2023 from external and internal stressors. Last night, QB Josh Allen and the hometown Bills struggled in a third loss in four weeks.</p>

<p> This time to the often self-destructive Denver Broncos.</p>

<p>But last night's game highlighted a growing concern amongst Buffalo fans.</p>

<p>Josh Allen is a turnover machine who tries to do too much. The frustration of the skill players is boiling over to the point that the offensive coordinator - Ken Dorsey - was fired. Head coach Sean McDermott finds himself firmly on the hot seat with his talented squad now 5-5.
</p>

<h2>
    Stefon Diggs, especially, has been frustrated.
</h2>

<p>
    The elite wideout has been seen vocalizing his frustrations with the coaching staff and his QB on the sideline during games over the last season and a half.</p>

<p>Those frustrations might boil over into more if his brother - Dallas Cowboys DB Trevon Diggs - has any idea what his brother is going through/feeling about the trajectory of the franchise.</p>

</p>

<p style="line-height: 48px;">Shots fired? Shots fired!<br>

Trevon made it clear - and then doubled down - that one, Allen is not doing enough to get his brother the ball. And two, Buffalo is not the right place for the talented pass-catcher.<br>

Does Trevon's word carry any weight? It sure does!<br>

Stefon might not be feeling as negatively as his brother might indicate on Twitter, but there must be some truth to it.<br>

Look at what has happened to Diggs' production in recent weeks.<br>

He had over 100 yards receiving yards in five of the first six games.<br>

He has not hit the century mark in the last four.<br>
</p>

<h1 style=" font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; width: 62%; text-align:left; font-size: 42px; font-weight: 800; margin: auto;"> Is this Stefon's last year with the Bills?</h1>

<P>
    Rumblings on social media suggest that we could see a split between Stefon Diggs and the Buffalo Bills similar to the one we saw with the Minnesota Vikings a few years ago.
</P>

<P>
    That may depend on how the offense does down the stretch - and whether or not the Bills make the postseason.
</P>

<h3>
    Could the Diggs brothers be partnering up with the Dallas Cowboys next season? I could see it happening!
